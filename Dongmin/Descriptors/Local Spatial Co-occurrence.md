## Review
### Problems of Related works
- The result of recognition on image can be easily affected by illumination, motion blur, viewpoint, or dynamic occlusion
- BoW-based schemes are robust to viewpoint, scale changes due to unordered quantization form. But, prone to lost the distinctiveness (quantization error occurs when voc is not rich enough to cover feature space).
- Hashing-based is hardly be established with no collision.
- VLAD(Vector of Locally Aggregated Desripotrs: One of BoW method) cna assemble quantization error with lossless tool in a relatively small vocaulary.
- Common KD-tree is fast but dificient in high dimensional space, a simple mean/medium merging is not reliable.

### Main Structures
Efficient and novel BoW LCD system which can execute online. 
1. Paper aims to develop more informative and efficient feature representation with depth into the spatial relationship over images, where local co-occurrence information is exploited
